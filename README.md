# Silent Fan Zero HAT
## A PWM to DC voltage conversion in HAT form factor

This board is based on the work of RÃ³bert LÅ‘rincz, from Transylvania, Romania (yes, from the place of Dracula). You can see the original board [here](https://orbiterprojects.com/silent-fan-driver/).

The main purpose of this board is to transform a PWM signal into a DC voltage, with benefits being:
* Lower fan noise;
* Better speed control;
* Longer fan lifetime;
* Lower fan vibrations.

Also, you (theoretically) can control lower voltage fans with this board by setting the maximum fan speed to lower values: using a 24V power supply, you'd use a maximum fan speed of 50% for a 12V fan, and 20% for a 5V fan.

### UPDATES:

May 4th, 2022: Initial public release (on Star Wars Day! May the Fourth be with you!). I had to reupload many files due to the fact that the pre-release version had messed up silkscreen. ðŸ™ƒ
